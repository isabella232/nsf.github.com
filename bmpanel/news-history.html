<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">29 June 2009</div><p>Couple of weeks ago I had created a development blog. My english sucks, but I&#8217;m
practicing.  Anyway, currently there are only few bmpanel2 entries in that
blog. If you&#8217;re interested in the bmpanel2 project, welcome!</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p><a href="http://nsfdev.wordpress.com">http://nsfdev.wordpress.com</a></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">2 June 2009</div><p>I suck at making videos. But anyway:
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bq_WLxeahY">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1bq_WLxeahY</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>This is my first youtube video ever uploaded :) So.. The demo shows 3 simple
features of upcoming bmpanel2: drag&#8217;n'drop tasks on taskbar, drag&#8217;n'drop tasks
from taskbar to desktop switcher (move tasks between desktops), and drag&#8217;n'drop
tasks out off the panel to kill them (close app). My english sucks too, just
see the video :)</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">28 April 2009</div><p>Misterious screenshot is
<a href="http://nsf.110mb.com/bmpanel/bmpanel2_wip.png">here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>What this is all about? Well, it&#8217;s a WIP (work in progress) bmpanel2
build. And as you can see, there is a plenty of things implemented.
Desktop switcher, taskbar and clock are fully functional. There is
actually one more type of a widget called "decor", but it&#8217;s not shown
on the screenshot. Decor widget allows you to put any image on the
panel. But it&#8217;s not the only thing hidden.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Here is a little summary.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Bmpanel2 is being built on top of four solid libraries. <strong>Cairo</strong> for
rendering, <strong>pango</strong> as a text layout engine, <strong>xlib</strong> as a X11
communication utility and <strong>glib2</strong> as a main loop implementation. It is
still carefully written in pure C. Bmpanel2 has a new theme format and
a completely redesigned internal structure, which allows you to create
new types of widgets really fast. And there are also few notable
things like drag&#8217;n'drop support, XDG conformance and settings file.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Even though it works already, there is a lot of things to be done. A
proper systray implementation, correct composite and shaping support,
documentation (which includes a man page, a theme tutorial and
technical notes for programmers), web page, new pack of
professionally designed themes, multihead support, etc.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>And after all, it needs to be tested. So.. keep this address in your
favourites and come back often, someday it will be released.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>P.S. Sources are available on my public git repo which is located on
my machine (browse sources <a href="http://jiss.convex.ru/git/bmpanel2.git">here</a>).
However, they are not usable for mere mortals yet, go there only if
you have programming interest.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">7 March 2009</div><p>I have opened a bug tracker for my projects
<a href="http://nsf.byethost8.com">here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>If you still have bug issues with bmpanel, probably I had ignored them
or completly had forgotten about them, please <strong>rereport</strong> them to the bug
tracker. Anonymous bug reports are allowed, at least until spam will
come out. In the bug tracker bugs will not get lost.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">13 February 2009</div><p>Exactly one year ago was the first commit of my very first open source
project - bmpanel.  And now it&#8217;s a time to say something about it&#8217;s
future. I was thinking about it for some time.  There are my thoughts:</p></div>
<div class="olist arabic"><ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>
Bmpanel requires a complete rewrite from scratch. I did a few
   critical mistakes and I will never fix them.  Not because I can&#8217;t, but
   I just won&#8217;t.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I thought about a lot of innovations for a new bmpanel, but these
   were evil thoughts. Bmpanel should continue to be small, simple and
   elegant.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
I thought about libraries that I will use in the new bmpanel. The
   panel really needs a good, solid base.  I decided to use gdk
   (installed in most distributions implicitly by gtk) and glib
   (generally a part of gtk, but actually qt links to it too). GDK for
   X11 interaction and for drawing, glib for mainloop. Even though Qt
   becomes LGPL, I don&#8217;t believe in C++ and my current choice is
   GTK-based desktop. Or maybe I will use the GTK itself, but look and
   feel definitely remains the same.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Main idea of the "rewrite" project: Make a simple, but useful panel
   as best as I can. Faithfully follow standards.  Be fearless against
   bugs.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
And well.. That&#8217;s it! It&#8217;s just words for now, the big part of
   these decisions is HARD WORK. Code, code, code.
</p>
</li>
</ol></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">17 September 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.27 release. Changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Bug fix. BMPanel had fail assumption that user always has wallpaper.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">14 August 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.26 release. Changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Correct include deps. There was a warning in previous version during
  compilation.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Class hint for PekWM, patch supplied by Tim Nieradzik. I didn&#8217;t test
  it, but it certainly doesn&#8217;t break anything.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudo-transparency">Pseudo-transparency</a>
  support. Now you can use transparent themes without composite mode.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
New theme for pseudo-transparency demonstration purposes - <a href="transpy.tar.gz">transpy.tar.gz</a>.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">23 July 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.25 release. Changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
New compilation options in configure script:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<tt> --with-ev </tt> - use libev to implement event loop
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<tt> --with-event </tt> - use libevent to implement event loop
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>These options are useful for those who have no glibc 2.8 (CVS version)
in their distribution.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">12 July 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.24 release. Changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Internal code cleanup (a little bit).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
A patch introduced by Henrique Dias, which adds support for
  customizing width of the panel and position on the X axis.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
The patch adds new variables to themes:
</p>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
<em>width</em> - specify width of the panel, number and optional <em>%</em>
    character at the end (for percentage value).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
<em>alignment</em> - specify panel alignment [left|center|right]
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Configure script checks for sys/timerfd.h now and in case if it
  wasn&#8217;t found gives a nice warning message.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>I know that there was a bug report about a tray icons rendering. I
didn&#8217;t forget about it, but it&#8217;s really hard to reproduce the effect
and also I have no idea what is wrong.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Also, notice a new theme in <a href="index.html#themes">Themes</a> section. It
was contributed by Henrique Dias and serves as an example of new
bmpanel <em>customizable width</em> thing.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">07 July 2008</div><p>Mailing list at groups.google.com. Please see a
<a href="index.html#mailing-list">mailing list</a> section.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">01 July 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.23 release. Notable changes are:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
x86_64 problems fix. BMPanel should work on x86_64 without any
  problems now.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Remove unnecessary panel redraws. It may cause regressions on some
  WMs. I didn&#8217;t check.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">26 June 2008</div><p>Add portability notice to bmpanel&#8217;s page.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">24 June 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.22 release. Few notable changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
New versioning scheme for me (no more forgetting to bump up version
  string).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
My helpful scripts are in the git repository now (and as a result in
  the source package).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Build system updates. Makefile supports external CFLAGS. The panel
  builds with <tt> -Wall </tt> flag. New options like <tt>
  --mem-debug </tt> . More beautiful summary table in configure
  script. Etc.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Tray placement bug fix (appeared in amsn). Thanks for bug report to
  Thomas Lundgaard.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Libev was removed from dependencies. Actually the panel doesn&#8217;t
  require <em>high performance</em> event loop. Because it isn&#8217;t a http
  server.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">11 June 2008</div><p>BMPanel&#8217;s page update. Old page is available
<a href="index-old.html">here</a>.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><div class="title">10 June 2008</div><p>BMPanel 0.9.21 release. There are not so many changes:</p></div>
<div class="ulist"><ul>
<li>
<p>
Remove scons build system. Replace it with custom configure and
  Makefile scripts. It isn&#8217;t definitely portable approach, but bmpanel
  isn&#8217;t portable app. It should work on latest linux distributions
  (better if distribution is "rolling releases" like gentoo or
  archlinux).
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
Few bug fixes. They were on git master for some time, now they are
  in the source distribution.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
It&#8217;s tradition and I forgot to bump up bmpanel&#8217;s version string. So,
  <tt> bmpanel --version </tt> shows wrong info. I need to rethink
  this versioning thing.
</p>
</li>
</ul></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>To install type: <tt> ./configure && make && make install </tt></p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>or <tt> ./configure --help </tt> for available options</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Makefile supports <strong>DESTDIR</strong> for package maintainers.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>However, my configure script and Makefiles are not perfect yet. I&#8217;m
working on it. For example, they lack global system CFLAGS support, to
use optimizations in PKGBUILD and gentoo&#8217;s ebuilds.</p></div>

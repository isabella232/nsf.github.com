BMPanel (BitMap Panel) is a lightweight, NETWM compliant panel for X11 Window System, which contains a desktop switcher, taskbar, system tray and clock. The application is inspired by simplicity of fspanel.[br][br]
BMPanel has a modern look and feel, while keeping itself tiny and small. It is written in C and has only few dependencies, such as: imlib2, xlib, fontconfig, xrender and xcomposite extensions. Also, the panel has a few notable features:[br]
[table=2]
[c,width=4][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c,width=100%]BMPanel can select ARGB visuals providing, together with composite manager, a true transparency (but system tray doesn't work in composite mode).
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]BMPanel has no configuration files. Its behaviour is customized via themes.
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]Well, it is themable!
[!table]
BMPanel doesn't try to be portable. It should work on a distribution with the latest Linux kernel and with the latest software (probably CVS/SVN/git versions). Supported architectures are x86 (32 bit) and x86_64 (64 bit). However, BMpanel may work on other distributions, kernels (like FreeBSD) and even architectures, but it isn't guaranteed.[br][br]

[table=2]
[c,width=4][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c,width=100%]New versioning scheme for me (no more forgetting to bump up version string).
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]My helpful scripts are in the git repository now (and as a result in the source package).
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]Build system updates. Makefile supports external CFLAGS. The panel builds with -Wall flag. New options like --mem-debug . More beautiful summary table in configure script. Etc.
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]Tray placement bug fix (appeared in amsn). Thanks for bug report to Thomas Lundgaard.
[c][align=r][b][color=g]* [!color][!b][!align][c]Libev was removed from dependencies. Actually the panel doesn't require high performance event loop. Because it isn't a http server.

[b][color=b]Development[!color][!b][br][br]
All open source projects are always in development. BMPanel is not an exception. It needs various contributions like:[br][br]
[b]Ports[!b]
[table=2][c,width=4][c,width=100%]BMPanel currently works only on x86 and x86_64 machines.[!table]
[b]Themes[!b]
[table=2][c,width=4][c,width=100%]If you are an artist or have such skills and you like bmpanel, you can make a theme, which will be included in source distribution. Even if you can't deal with actual theme creation, just draw a look of theme and I or someone else will help you create actual theme.[!table]
[b]Distribution[!b]
[table=2][c,width=4][c,width=100%]Wider distribution means more chances to get what I need (and possibly others too). Make a package for your Linux distribution or suggest your friend to try bmpanel.[!table]
[b]Bug reports[!b]
[table=2][c,width=4][c,width=100%]There are bugs in software. Always. If something works wrong or doesn't work at all, don't delete bmpanel, first of all, let me know.[!table]
